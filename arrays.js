// An Array is basically a variable that can hold many different values

let a = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]; // an array of numeric values 
let b = [ 'david', 'eddie', 'alex', 'michael' ]; // an array of strings

// NOTE: Index starts at 0, so in the above array, 4 is at index 0, 8 is at index 1 and so on
console.log(a[0]); // prints value of the array located at index 0, printing 4
console.log(a[1]); // prints value of the array located at index 2, printing 8
console.log(a); // prints the entire contents of the array, printing [ 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 ]
